I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys   Gold-digger,  cradle robbing perv!

You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!"}, {"speaker": "ross", "text": "Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh!"}, {"speaker": "rachel", "text": "Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?"}, {"speaker": "ross", "text": "The most amazing thing happened tonight.

I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now."}, {"speaker": "rachel", "text": "Because a car backfired?"}, {"speaker": "ross", "text": "Okay, why are you here?"}, {"speaker": "rachel", "text": "Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole \"seizing\" thing but um, Emily called you today."}, {"speaker": "ross", "text": "You talked to her?"}, {"speaker": "rachel", "text": "No, she left a message.   But it-it kinda got erased. There's just  something wrong with your machine."}, {"speaker": "ross", "text": "Well, okay, what-what did she say?"}, {"speaker": "rachel", "text": "Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her."}, {"speaker": "ross", "text": "Wow!"}, {"speaker": "rachel", "text": "Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?"}, {"speaker": "ross", "text": "Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!"}, {"speaker": "rachel", "text": "Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because\u0097I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me\u0097not important.

I guess, I guess I should call Emily."}, {"speaker": "rachel", "text": "Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?"}, {"speaker": "ross", "text": "Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that- that has got to mean something!"}, {"speaker": "rachel", "text": "Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!"}, {"speaker": "ross", "text": "You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?"}, {"speaker": "rachel", "text": "Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff."}, {"speaker": "ross", "text": "Huh."}, {"speaker": "rachel", "text": "I mean, look-look today you escaped   death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?"}, {"speaker": "ross", "text": "That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her."}, {"speaker": "rachel", "text": "Well, there you go!"}, {"speaker": "ross", "text": "Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day."}, {"speaker": "rachel", "text": "Close call day."}, {"speaker": "ross", "text": "Hey, thanks Rach."}, {"speaker": "rachel", "text": "Ohh, honey no problem. Okay."}, {"speaker": "ross", "text": "Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking.
