Really?!"}, {"speaker": "joey", "text": "Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn\u0092t the hair straightener that started the fire.  No-no, it was the candles. It\u0092s very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is  Uhh Uhh Okay. Well, I have to go now."}, {"speaker": "ross", "text": "We had such a great time! She\u0092s-she\u0092s incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn\u0092t.
