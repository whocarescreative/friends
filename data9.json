If you want to sleep with him, do it on your own time.  This is a play. No, listen: if you insist on this, I will call my agent so fast on a cell phone that has a connection that is so clear he's gonna think I'm next door.            Joey:  Ah, hi, ah. Thank you so much for whispering for my benefit, but, ah, look, if you just tell me what I did wrong, I'd just love to work on it and come back and try it again for you. And, and also:  'How you doing?'  You should, please, just gimme another chance. I really wanna get better, please.      Lennart: Well, if you wanna come back at the end of the day today, here are my notes. Ready?      Joey: Yeah.      Lennart: Uhm, you're in your head. You-you're thinking way too much.      Joey: I really doubt that.      Lennart:  No, no, no. It's that you're not connected with anything in your body. There's no urgency. The scene is a struggle, uhm, it's a race. Also, what you did was horizontal. Don't be afraid to explore the vertical. And don't learn the words. Let the words learn you.            Joey:  Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?               Phoebe: Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight?      Ross: Oh, I can't. I've got a date with that waitress, Katy, yeah, I know we've been only going out like twice, but I have a really good feeling about her.      Phoebe: Oh, I hear divorce bells.            Mugger: Alright. Just give me your wallets and there won't be a problem.      Ross:  What?      Mugger: I have a gun       Ross: O-ok. Just relax, Phoene, just stay calm. . Oh my god, I can't find my wallet.            Mugger: Alright, lady, now give me your purse!      Phoebe: No.      Ross:  What do you mean \"no\"? I knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay.

Lowell: Ross, nice to meet you.       Ross: Yeah, a real pleasure.      Phoebe: Ah, it's been so long, so long.  I can't believe you're still doing this!      Lowell: Ough, I know, but I quit smoking!      Phoebe: Good for you!      Lowell: So you look like you're doing really well! I guess you're mugging days are behind you?      Phoebe: Ouh       Ross:  Oh my god. Phoebe, you used to mug people?      Phoebe: Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up               Monica: Hey, how did the audition go?      Joey: Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Lennart Haze did not like me.       Monica: What happened?      Joey: Well, he said I wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical. Oh, and he said that I should think less.      Monica: So far so good!       Chandler:  Honey, I'm old!      Monica:  What's wrong?      Chandler: I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.      Monica: So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience.      Chandler: Yes, but I don't think life experience with these.       Joey: Wooooooooow  It's like they're on fire!      Monica: What are they?       Chandler: They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.      Joey:  I give you $ 500 for them!      Chandler: What am I supposed to do with these?      Monica: Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time.      Chandler: Well, first of all, they're not called \"sneakers\" anymore. Apparently, they're called \"kicks\" or \"skids\" and I think I heard somebody say \"slorps\".  And here, look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. Kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity!  Would you help me try to sell these?      Monica: Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?      Chandler: No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for.      Joey: Hey, that'd work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords?               All: Hey, hey!      Ross: Hey, you'll never guess what just happened Phoebe and I got mugged!      Monica: You okay?!      Ross:  Yah, because Phoebe knew the mugger!      Monica:  How do you know a mugger?      Phoebe: I'm sorry I have friends outside the six of us.      Ross: You wanna know how she knew him?  Because Phoebe used to mug people.      Monica:  Seriously?      Phoebe: Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I      Monica:  Phoebe, that is awful!      Phoebe: Well, ok, I wasn't rich like you guys, ok, I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony I had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer      Monica: You're mother killed herself!      Phoebe: She was a drug dealer!      Ross: Well, anyway, it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him, because  I was about to do some serious damage!      Phoebe:  Okay      Monica: Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross.      Phoebe: Why?      Monica: Well, Ross was mugged as a kid.      Phoebe:  You were?      Ross: Yeah, it was pretty traumatic. I was outside St. Marc's Comics you know, I-I-I was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week-      Monica:  Wonderwoman!      Ross: Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen Linzer torts for someone   when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says: \"Gimme your money, punk!\"      Phoebe:  Oh my god      Ross: I know! And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book: \"Science Boy\"      Monica: Oh yeah! What was his superpower again?      Ross: A superhuman thirst for knowledge.      Monica: That's it.      Ross: Well, I-I better get to class  Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way, Phoebe?      Phoebe: No actually, you might wanna stay away from Jane street that's where stabby Joe works.            Phoebe: Okay, I think we have a problem here.      Monica: What?      Phoebe: Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc's Comics.      Monica: Yeah?      Phoebe: Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat.      Monica: So?      Phoebe: Well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said-      Phoebe and Monica: \"Geology rocks!\"      Monica: Oh my god!      Phoebe: I know I mugged Ross!               Receptionist: You're late!      Joey:  I know, I'm sorry, but can I just have a quick second to run to the bathroom?      Receptionist: No, Lennart doesn't wait!      Joey: But I'm bursting with u-hu!      Lennart:  Joey! Here we go. Let's go very quickly!      Joey: Actually, I really need      Lennart:  We must go now, quickly, please.

You know what?\"      Lennart: \"What?\"      Joey: \"I could go right now.\"      Lennart: \"Then go, go!\"      Joey:  \"I, oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!\"      Lennart: Cut! That was good.  That was very good. You did everything I asked for.      Joey:  I did?      Lennart: Yes.

Phoebe:  Yeah, and I'm so, so sorry, Ross, I'm sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, it's kinda neat.  I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and I have have a great one!

So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know maybe he falls maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: \"Not suitable for adults!\"      Boss: Chandler, that's great!      Chandler: Oh, thank you, sir or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me       Boss: You see? That has a clear selling point. It appeals to our key demographic, it's .  You did you come up with that?      Chandler:  I don't know, I don' I don' know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow.      Boss: That is great. Good work!      Chandler. Thank you.      Boss: See all of you tomorrow.             Chandler: The cold weather hurts my hip!               Phoebe: Hey, Ross!  I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second?      Ross: Sure, go ahead. Whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead.       Phoebe: I just really wanted to apologize again and and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting.            Ross:  Oh my god, crap from the street?       Phoebe: Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell or smoke.  Anyway, I was looking through it and I found \"Science Boy\"       Ross: Oh my god.  I never thought I'd see this again.  It's all here. What made you save it all these years?      Phoebe: I can't say, I just thought it was really good and maybe would be worth something some day.      Ross: You really thought \"Science Boy\" was worth saving!      Phoebe: Yeah but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here.      Ross: Still this is amazing Oh my god, thank you, Phoebe.      Phoebe: You're welcome. And thank you for \"Science Boy\". I learned a lot from him      Ross: You're welcome.               Joey:  \"I need an answer!\"      Lennart: \"I-I-I can't tell you somethin' I don't know.\"      Joey: \"You know!\"      Lennart: \"I don't know!\"      Joey: \"I need an answer now!\"      Lennart: \"Alright, here, you want an answer the answer is \"            Joey:  Oh!      Lennart: \"She never loved me, she only loved you.\"      Joey: \"You knew this all along and you never told me? You never told me? I can never forgive you, I can never forgive myself, I have nothing to live for \u0096 Bang \u0096 End Scene!\"      Lennart: Absolutely amazing!  The part is yours.      Joey:  Oh thanks, thanks! Now, I really have to get      Lennart: Wa-wa-wa-wait! Congratulations! You did it! You did it!  You can relax now. Yeah.            Closing Credits            Monica: Wow, that's a big cable bill! Huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn on a Saturday afternoon?!  I was in the house!      Ross:  Hey, uhm, Phoebe didn't by any chance mention that      Monica:  that she was the huge guy that mugged you? Yah.      Ross: I see. You didn't happen to tell      Monica:  everybody we know? Yeah.      Ross: Great. Thanks!       End"
