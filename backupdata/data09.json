Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.\nJoey/Drake: I can't believe you married him.\nRachel/actress: But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister in a dungeon!\nJoey/Drake: So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.\nRachel/actress: It's over! You have to accept that.\nJoey/Drake: How can I? Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again, or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you? How can I accept that... I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not to kiss you right now.\nRachel:  Kiss me.\nJoey: What?\nRachel: Kiss me.\nJoey: Ah, Rach, it doesn't say that!\nRachel: No, I'm saying...\nJoey: but, but..\nRachel: just... don't talk... \n[Scene: Rachel's bedroom]\nRachel:  Ehhh, aw! . Well, that's new!\n[Scene: Hotel's room]\nRoss:  Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room?  Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already?  Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons. \nRoss: What did you get?\nChandler: USA Today\nRoss: Nice, put it with the others.\nChandler: And I also got... two more apples.\nRoss: We are four short of a bush-o . God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!  \nChandler: I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.\nRoss: Oh, that's not cool.\nChandlers: Dude, none of this is cool.\nRoss: No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes.  Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt  I wish I'd thought this through.\nChandler: I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that.\nRoss: Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.\nChandler: Ok, how about this ?\nRoss: No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!\nChandler: Yes, but the batteries...\nChandler: Thank you, thank you very much!\nRoss: Let's celebrate with some maple candy!\nChandler: No!\nRoss: At least tell me where you hid it.\n[Scene: Central Perk. Monica and Rachel are sitting on the sofa]\nRachel: Can I ask you a question?\nMonica: Yeah.\nRachel: Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?\nMonica: Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.\nRachel: Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.\nMonica: Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?\nRachel: Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.\nMonica: What do you think brought than on?\nRachel: I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.\nMonica: A love scene? With who?\nRachel: Olivia.\nMonica: Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor!  Oh right, real life more important.\nRachel: So do you think that my dream means anything?\nMonica: I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.\nRachel: Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...\nMonica: Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college. \nRachel: You took the same class twice.\nMonica: It was hard!\nPhoebe: Hey!\nRachel and Monica: Hi.\nPhoebe: Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant  uh, huh wait!  Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.\nMonica: Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.\nPhoebe: Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.\nMonica: Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.\nPhoebe: Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back .\nRachel: Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...\nPhoebe: My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?\nRachel: Ok, we're still on that.\nMonica: I didn't say your songs were not good enough.\nPhoebe: Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?\nMonica: Tiny portions?\nPhoebe: Yeah well, \"excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but  I can't see it, I can't see it\"!\nMonica: Phoebe, it's not about quantity.\nPhoebe: Well...it's not about quality.\nMonica: Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.\nPhoebe: Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.\nMonica: Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.\nPhoebe: Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?\nMonica: You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.\nPhoebe: What are people having, the garlic Martini?\n[Scene: Hotel's reception]\nReceptionist: Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.\nChandler: Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.\nChandler: Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.\nRoss: Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game.\nRoss: Oh my god.\nChandler: What?\nRoss: There's something new in the bowl.\nChandler: Look, we have enough, just walk away.\nRoss: No, but I want...I want the pinecones!\nChandler: There's a forest right outside.\nRoss: It's not the same.\nChandler: Ok, go quick!\nRoss:  Thank you for a delightful stay.\nRoss: Oh, my maple candy!\n[Scene: In front of Monica's restaurant. Phoebe is playing]\nPhoebe:  Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you..\nMonica: Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.\nPhoebe: You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.\nMonica: Ok, you have to stop playing now.\nPhoebe: Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!\nMonica: Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!\nPhoebe:  Get your garlic-peelers off me!\nMonica:  Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. .. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside? \nPhoebe: Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside?  Ha!\nMonica: Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? .\nPhoebe: Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?\nMonica: Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? \nPhoebe: Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? .\nMonica: Excuse us!  Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? \nPhoebe: Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! \nMonica: I'm sorry...\nPhoebe: I'm sorry too... \nMonica: ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner? \nPhoebe: Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p... \nPhoebe:  Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?\n[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment, Rachel walks in]\nRachel: Hey!\nJoey: Hey!\nRachel: Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?\nJoey:  Oh man! I thought I got it all!\nRachel:  How...how...?\nJoey: I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right? \nRachel: uh-huh\nJoey: And I couldn't find this little plastic thing  that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very! \nRachel:  Wow...definitely just Drake...\nJoey: What?\nRachel: What...how is it going with Drake?\nJoey: Oh...I don't think it's going very well...\nRachel: What...that scene I saw was so good!\nJoey: Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...\nRachel: Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?\nJoey: A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.\nRachel: So?\nJoey: So...I've never played that!\nRachel: Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?\nJoey: Uh...well...just once...with you...\nRachel: Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?\nJoey:  What the hell are you talking about??\nRachel:  Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how  you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene.\nJoey:  Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.\nRachel:  Joey, you never..you never talked about that before...\nJoey: Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know?  And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful...  and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you  but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.\nJoey:  Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! \nClosing credits"}, {"actor": "Joey", "text": "I want you.I need you.Let me make love to you."}, {"actor": "Rachel", "text": "I don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but I think a \ncantaloupe might hurt less."}, {"actor": "Joey", "text": "Oh, ehm...I'm...I'm rehearsing my lines.They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives.

I thought I got it all!\nRachel:  How...how...?\nJoey: I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right? \nRachel: uh-huh\nJoey: And I couldn't find this little plastic thing  that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very! \nRachel:  Wow...definitely just Drake...\nJoey: What?\nRachel: What...how is it going with Drake?\nJoey: Oh...I don't think it's going very well...\nRachel: What...that scene I saw was so good!\nJoey: Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...\nRachel: Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?\nJoey: A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.\nRachel: So?\nJoey: So...I've never played that!\nRachel: Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?\nJoey: Uh...well...just once...with you...\nRachel: Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?\nJoey:  What the hell are you talking about??\nRachel:  Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how  you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene.\nJoey:  Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.\nRachel:  Joey, you never..you never talked about that before...\nJoey: Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know?  And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful...  and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you  but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.\nJoey:  Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! \nClosing credits"}, {"actor": "Chandler", "text": "Have I got a surprise for you?

Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already?  Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons. \nRoss: What did you get?\nChandler: USA Today\nRoss: Nice, put it with the others.\nChandler: And I also got... two more apples.\nRoss: We are four short of a bush-o . God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!  \nChandler: I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.\nRoss: Oh, that's not cool.\nChandlers: Dude, none of this is cool.\nRoss: No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes.  Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt  I wish I'd thought this through.\nChandler: I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that.\nRoss: Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.\nChandler: Ok, how about this ?\nRoss: No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!\nChandler: Yes, but the batteries...\nChandler: Thank you, thank you very much!\nRoss: Let's celebrate with some maple candy!\nChandler: No!\nRoss: At least tell me where you hid it.\n[Scene: Central Perk. Monica and Rachel are sitting on the sofa]\nRachel: Can I ask you a question?\nMonica: Yeah.\nRachel: Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?\nMonica: Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.\nRachel: Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.\nMonica: Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?\nRachel: Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.\nMonica: What do you think brought than on?\nRachel: I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.\nMonica: A love scene? With who?\nRachel: Olivia.\nMonica: Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor!  Oh right, real life more important.\nRachel: So do you think that my dream means anything?\nMonica: I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.\nRachel: Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...\nMonica: Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college. \nRachel: You took the same class twice.\nMonica: It was hard!\nPhoebe: Hey!\nRachel and Monica: Hi.\nPhoebe: Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant  uh, huh wait!  Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.\nMonica: Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.\nPhoebe: Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.\nMonica: Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.\nPhoebe: Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back .\nRachel: Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...\nPhoebe: My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?\nRachel: Ok, we're still on that.\nMonica: I didn't say your songs were not good enough.\nPhoebe: Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?\nMonica: Tiny portions?\nPhoebe: Yeah well, \"excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but  I can't see it, I can't see it\"!\nMonica: Phoebe, it's not about quantity.\nPhoebe: Well...it's not about quality.\nMonica: Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.\nPhoebe: Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.\nMonica: Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.\nPhoebe: Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?\nMonica: You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.\nPhoebe: What are people having, the garlic Martini?\n[Scene: Hotel's reception]\nReceptionist: Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.\nChandler: Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.\nChandler: Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.\nRoss: Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game.\nRoss: Oh my god.\nChandler: What?\nRoss: There's something new in the bowl.\nChandler: Look, we have enough, just walk away.\nRoss: No, but I want...I want the pinecones!\nChandler: There's a forest right outside.\nRoss: It's not the same.\nChandler: Ok, go quick!\nRoss:  Thank you for a delightful stay.\nRoss: Oh, my maple candy!\n[Scene: In front of Monica's restaurant. Phoebe is playing]\nPhoebe:  Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you..\nMonica: Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.\nPhoebe: You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.\nMonica: Ok, you have to stop playing now.\nPhoebe: Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!\nMonica: Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!\nPhoebe:  Get your garlic-peelers off me!\nMonica:  Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. .. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside? \nPhoebe: Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside?  Ha!\nMonica: Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? .\nPhoebe: Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?\nMonica: Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? \nPhoebe: Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? .\nMonica: Excuse us!  Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? \nPhoebe: Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! \nMonica: I'm sorry...\nPhoebe: I'm sorry too... \nMonica: ooohh... hey!

Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt  I wish I'd thought this through.\nChandler: I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that.\nRoss: Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.\nChandler: Ok, how about this ?\nRoss: No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!\nChandler: Yes, but the batteries...\nChandler: Thank you, thank you very much!\nRoss: Let's celebrate with some maple candy!\nChandler: No!\nRoss: At least tell me where you hid it.\n[Scene: Central Perk. Monica and Rachel are sitting on the sofa]\nRachel: Can I ask you a question?\nMonica: Yeah.\nRachel: Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?\nMonica: Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.\nRachel: Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.\nMonica: Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?\nRachel: Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.\nMonica: What do you think brought than on?\nRachel: I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.\nMonica: A love scene? With who?\nRachel: Olivia.\nMonica: Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor!  Oh right, real life more important.\nRachel: So do you think that my dream means anything?\nMonica: I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.\nRachel: Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...\nMonica: Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college. \nRachel: You took the same class twice.\nMonica: It was hard!\nPhoebe: Hey!\nRachel and Monica: Hi.\nPhoebe: Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant  uh, huh wait!  Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.\nMonica: Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.\nPhoebe: Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.\nMonica: Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.\nPhoebe: Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back .\nRachel: Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...\nPhoebe: My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?\nRachel: Ok, we're still on that.\nMonica: I didn't say your songs were not good enough.\nPhoebe: Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?\nMonica: Tiny portions?\nPhoebe: Yeah well, \"excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but  I can't see it, I can't see it\"!\nMonica: Phoebe, it's not about quantity.\nPhoebe: Well...it's not about quality.\nMonica: Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.\nPhoebe: Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.\nMonica: Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.\nPhoebe: Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?\nMonica: You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.\nPhoebe: What are people having, the garlic Martini?\n[Scene: Hotel's reception]\nReceptionist: Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.\nChandler: Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.\nChandler: Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.\nRoss: Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game.\nRoss: Oh my god.\nChandler: What?\nRoss: There's something new in the bowl.\nChandler: Look, we have enough, just walk away.\nRoss: No, but I want...I want the pinecones!\nChandler: There's a forest right outside.\nRoss: It's not the same.\nChandler: Ok, go quick!\nRoss:  Thank you for a delightful stay.\nRoss: Oh, my maple candy!\n[Scene: In front of Monica's restaurant. Phoebe is playing]\nPhoebe:  Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you..\nMonica: Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.\nPhoebe: You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.\nMonica: Ok, you have to stop playing now.\nPhoebe: Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!\nMonica: Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!\nPhoebe:  Get your garlic-peelers off me!\nMonica:  Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. .. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside? \nPhoebe: Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside?  Ha!\nMonica: Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? .\nPhoebe: Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?\nMonica: Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? \nPhoebe: Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? .\nMonica: Excuse us!  Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? \nPhoebe: Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! \nMonica: I'm sorry...\nPhoebe: I'm sorry too... \nMonica: ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner? \nPhoebe: Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p... \nPhoebe:  Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?\n[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment, Rachel walks in]\nRachel: Hey!\nJoey: Hey!\nRachel: Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?\nJoey:  Oh man! I thought I got it all!\nRachel:  How...how...?\nJoey: I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right? \nRachel: uh-huh\nJoey: And I couldn't find this little plastic thing  that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very! \nRachel:  Wow...definitely just Drake...\nJoey: What?\nRachel: What...how is it going with Drake?\nJoey: Oh...I don't think it's going very well...\nRachel: What...that scene I saw was so good!\nJoey: Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...\nRachel: Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?\nJoey: A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.\nRachel: So?\nJoey: So...I've never played that!\nRachel: Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?\nJoey: Uh...well...just once...with you...\nRachel: Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?\nJoey:  What the hell are you talking about??\nRachel:  Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how  you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene.\nJoey:  Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.\nRachel:  Joey, you never..you never talked about that before...\nJoey: Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know?  And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful...  and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you  but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.\nJoey:  Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! \nClosing credits"}, {"actor": "Rachel", "text": "OH!"}, {"actor": "Actress/Olivia", "text": "No, I told you...get out!"}, {"actor": "Joey/Drake", "text": "Fine.

Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.\nRachel: Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.\nMonica: Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?\nRachel: Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.\nMonica: What do you think brought than on?\nRachel: I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.\nMonica: A love scene? With who?\nRachel: Olivia.\nMonica: Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor!  Oh right, real life more important.\nRachel: So do you think that my dream means anything?\nMonica: I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.\nRachel: Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...\nMonica: Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college. \nRachel: You took the same class twice.\nMonica: It was hard!\nPhoebe: Hey!\nRachel and Monica: Hi.\nPhoebe: Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant  uh, huh wait!  Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.\nMonica: Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.\nPhoebe: Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.\nMonica: Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.\nPhoebe: Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back .\nRachel: Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...\nPhoebe: My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?\nRachel: Ok, we're still on that.\nMonica: I didn't say your songs were not good enough.\nPhoebe: Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?\nMonica: Tiny portions?\nPhoebe: Yeah well, \"excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but  I can't see it, I can't see it\"!\nMonica: Phoebe, it's not about quantity.\nPhoebe: Well...it's not about quality.\nMonica: Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.\nPhoebe: Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.\nMonica: Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.\nPhoebe: Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?\nMonica: You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.\nPhoebe: What are people having, the garlic Martini?\n[Scene: Hotel's reception]\nReceptionist: Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.\nChandler: Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.\nChandler: Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.\nRoss: Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car.

Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside? \nPhoebe: Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside?  Ha!\nMonica: Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? .\nPhoebe: Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?\nMonica: Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? \nPhoebe: Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? .\nMonica: Excuse us!  Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? \nPhoebe: Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! \nMonica: I'm sorry...\nPhoebe: I'm sorry too... \nMonica: ooohh... hey!

Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.\nRachel: So?\nJoey: So...I've never played that!\nRachel: Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?\nJoey: Uh...well...just once...with you...\nRachel: Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?\nJoey:  What the hell are you talking about??\nRachel:  Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how  you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene.\nJoey:  Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.\nRachel:  Joey, you never..you never talked about that before...\nJoey: Well.. hey, you know what else I could use?

Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?\nMonica: Tiny portions?\nPhoebe: Yeah well, \"excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but  I can't see it, I can't see it\"!\nMonica: Phoebe, it's not about quantity.\nPhoebe: Well...it's not about quality.\nMonica: Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.\nPhoebe: Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.\nMonica: Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.\nPhoebe: Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?\nMonica: You know what? I take back what I said before.

Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? \nPhoebe: Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! \nMonica: I'm sorry...\nPhoebe: I'm sorry too... \nMonica: ooohh... hey!

Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?\nJoey: Uh...well...just once...with you...\nRachel: Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?\nJoey:  What the hell are you talking about??\nRachel:  Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how  you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene.\nJoey:  Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that.

Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside? \nPhoebe: Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside?  Ha!\nMonica: Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? .\nPhoebe: Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?\nMonica: Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone? \nPhoebe: Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? .\nMonica: Excuse us!  Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now? \nPhoebe: Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great! \nMonica: I'm sorry...\nPhoebe: I'm sorry too... \nMonica: ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner? \nPhoebe: Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p... \nPhoebe:  Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?\n[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment, Rachel walks in]\nRachel: Hey!\nJoey: Hey!\nRachel: Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?\nJoey:  Oh man! I thought I got it all!\nRachel:  How...how...?\nJoey: I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right? \nRachel: uh-huh\nJoey: And I couldn't find this little plastic thing  that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very! \nRachel:  Wow...definitely just Drake...\nJoey: What?\nRachel: What...how is it going with Drake?\nJoey: Oh...I don't think it's going very well...\nRachel: What...that scene I saw was so good!\nJoey: Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...\nRachel: Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?\nJoey: A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.\nRachel: So?\nJoey: So...I've never played that!\nRachel: Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?\nJoey: Uh...well...just once...with you...\nRachel: Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?\nJoey:  What the hell are you talking about??\nRachel:  Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how  you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene.\nJoey:  Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.\nRachel:  Joey, you never..you never talked about that before...\nJoey: Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know?  And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful...  and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you  but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.\nJoey:  Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! \nClosing credits"}, {"actor": "Monica", "text": "Thank god, it's just you!

It's good to meet you! Thank you so much for taking the time out to show me around.\nRoss: Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out.\nMonica:  Is he gonna introduce us?\nChandler:  No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.\nCharlie: And, by the way, I really enjoyed your paper on the connection between geographic isolation and rapid mutagenesis.\nRoss: Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute.\nMonica:  Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.\nRoss:   We should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover.\nCharlie: Oh, ah, isn't there another professor that is supposed to come with us?\nRoss: I don't think so.\nCharlie: I'm pretty sure, professor Spafford from Cornell?\nRoss: Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is \"if you can't come on time, then don't come at all\".

I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!\nRachel: Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??\nJoey: Yeah...\nRachel: And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?\nJoey: Yeah...\nRachel: OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?\nJoey:  I can't believe you guys went for that one!\nRachel: Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?\nJoey: You're fine, ok?

I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!!\nCharlie: Oh, Newcastle disease is a secretion borne virus that only affects chickens and... other poultry.\nRachel: ...

I can barely control myself.\nPhoebe: Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway? \nMonica:  Oh my God! Chandler!\n[Scene: The theater. Chandler is sitting in the otherwise empty front row, looking around nervously]\nChandler: Where the hell is everybody?\nBitter lady:  Why don't you like me?! Chapter One: My first period.\n[Scene: The Roof, Rachel is talking to a guy who hands her a tissue with something written on it]\nMonica:  Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this \"best wishes\" crap. I want \"love\".\nRachel: Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number.\nMonica: Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!\nMatthew Ashford: It was nice to meet you Rachel.\nRachel: Nice to meet you.\nMatthew Ashford: Call me.\nRachel: Ok\nMonica:  We will!!\nMonica:  Look at you with all the guys!\nRachel: Yeah!\nMonica: I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?\nRachel: Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!\nMonica: Please... Chandler is the love of my life... ... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! \nRoss:  So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?\nCharlie: Actually, I'm kinda happy to be leaving... I just broke up with someeone.\nRoss: Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?\nCharlie: Actually, Alby is the guy I broke up with.\nRoss: You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?\nCharlie: Yeah...\nRoss: ... And you called him Alby!?  I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...\nCharlie: Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.\nRoss: Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!\nCharlie: Yes! And while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend, he had a lot of issues...\nRoss:  Oh! like what?!  Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch \"Access Hollywood\".\nCharlie: Ok, you want the dirt? Alby was seriously insecure. I mean, he was really intimidated by the guy I dated before him.\nRoss: Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?\nCharlie: A guy who won two.\nRoss:  Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart\nCharlie: Yeah... for three years.\nRoss: Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?\nCharlie: ... no... bu but there was my first boyfriend Billy.\nRoss: Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?\nCharlie: No, but he did just win the McArthur genius grant.\nRoss: Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine? \nPhoebe: Hey Ross!\nRache: How is it going with Charlie?\nRoss:  Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.\nPhoebe: Oh, What's the matter?\nRoss: She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.\nRachel: I always loved that!!\nRoss: Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!!  Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God!\nPhoebe: Worse?\nRoss: Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians...  \"Can we walk\"?  Oh, you... you like that?\nPhoebe:  No. \nRoss: What? \nRachel: Come on! I think this is funny! \n[Scene: Chandler in the theater]\nBitter lady: Well, I bet you are all thinkin' \"Now would be a really great time for an intermission\", huh?\nChandler:  oh yes, God yes!!\nBitter lady:  Well, you're not gonna get one! Because in life there are no intermissions, people. Chapter 7: Divorce is a 4 letter word.  How could he leave me?!?!\nChandler: I... I don't know... you seem lovely.\n[Scene: The roof, Joey is walking towards Ross with a guy]\nJoey: Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk.  Dirk, this is my good friend Ross. \nRoss: Nice to meet you.\nDirk: Hey! So what show are you on?\nRoss: Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology.\nJoey: It's a science.\nDirk: Oh! Hey well listen, I play a scientist on \"Days\". And my character has just won the Nobel prize.\nJoey: Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...\nRoss: Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.\nDirk: Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs.\nRoss: I'd lead with that.\nMonica: That's it, just sign right on the bra .\nJoey: Monica!\nMonica: Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year!\nJoey:  What have you got there?\nRoss: Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.\nJoey: Ah, let me see!  Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?\nRachel:  I think I am.\nJoey:  Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug . This guy's Canadian . And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different.\nJoey:  Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass...\nRachel:  Why, why, what's wrong with these guys?\nJoey: Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.\nRachel: Joey, you're so sweet.\nJoey: That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight.\nRachel: Who ?\nJoey: Me.\nRachel:  What?  Really?\nJoey: Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!\nRachel: Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it! \nJoey: Gotcha.\nRachel: Oh, Very funny... Joey.\nChandler:  So, how did you enjoy the play?\nMonica: Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry.\nChandler: Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.\nMonica: You really liked it?\nChandler: Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained  not to listen!  But after chapter 16: \"fat, single and ready to mingle\", I was uplifted.\nMonica: Oh really!\nChandler: Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!\nMonica: No!\nChandler: Did somebody sign your bra?\nMonica: So I got it when I was 13...\n[Scene: At the counter. Ross is sitting there, drinking. Phoebe approaches him.]\nPhoebe: Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?\nRoss: It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize.\nPhoebe: Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, \nslum it with some average Joe Phd.\nRoss: Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.\nPhoebe: You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny...\nRoss: And sexy.\nPhoebe: Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!\nRoss: Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her.\nPhoebe: Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!\nRoss: Stop going through my stuff !\nRachel:  Hey!\nMonica: Hey!\nRachel: I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.\nMonica: No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.\nRachel: Please, what about you and Chandler?\nMonica: That's different! I was drunk and stupid!\nRachel: Well hello !\nMonica: What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?\nRachel: I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!\nMonica: Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.\nRachel:  I'm gonna do it.\nMonica: And I can't stop you.\nRachel: No.\nRoss:  Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?\nRoss: I'm smarter than him!\nClosing credits[Scene: The theater. Monica, Phoebe and Chandler are sitting in the first line]\nPhoebe: Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.\nChandler: Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.\nMonica: Oh, you're so wonderful.\nBitter woman: Why don't you like me!

There was a sea food buffet you wouldn't believe. There were clams, and mussels, and oysters, and cracked crab, and snow crab, and king crab. It's a pity I'm allergic to shellfish.\nRoss:  So, where did you get your undergraduate degree?\nProfessor Spafford: And that's not all I'm allergic to.\nRoss:  Oh, it's not over!\nProfessor Spafford: I'm also allergic to peanuts, and cashews, and almonds, and filberts...\nRoss: So basically all nuts?\nProfessor Spafford: Interestingly... no.\nCharlie: Kinda playing fast and loose with the word \"interesting\".\nProfessor Spafford: If you'll excuse me I'm going to use the restroom. \nCharlie: Oh my God!!\nRoss: I've lost the will to live.\nCharlie: Let's ditch him!\nRoss: What?\nCharlie: Come on, he's still in the bathroom! I'm begging you!\nRoss: Oh... ok, fine. But... ehm... I just have one question for you, ehm...  When we exit should we walk, or run, or prance, or stroll...\nCharlie: Stop it, stop it!

Charlie, this is Phoebe and my sister, Monica.\nPhoebe: Hi!\nRoss: Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department.\nPhoebe: Oh, you're a paleonthologist, too!  Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?\nCharlie: Well, I think he's a little out there, but he does have some interesting ideas...\nPhoebe: Ah, ah.\nCharlie:  Oh, I'm sorry. I'll take this. Excuse me. \nRoss:  Ranion's theory of species variegation?\nPhoebe: Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!\nMonica:  So, did you two have fun?\nRoss: Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny...\nMonica: And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a  HOTTY!!  HI!\nRachel:  Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play.\nRoss: Really? Wh-what's wrong?\nRachel: I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh, you know... I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!!\nCharlie: Oh, Newcastle disease is a secretion borne virus that only affects chickens and... other poultry.\nRachel: ... Ok, who is this?\nRoss: I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.\nRachel: Oh, hi! I would check your hand but... I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease!\nMonica: Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec?\nRachel: Sure!  Oh...\nMonica: You're not sick!\nRachel: What? Yes, I am!\nMonica: Ok, then, why are you...  all dressed up??\nRachel: When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better! \nMonica: You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!\nRachel: Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!\nMonica: Ok, what is this?\nRachel: Ok!  Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!\nMonica:  WHAT?\nRoss:  Wh-what's going on?\nMonica: Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!\nRachel: And he didn't want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you!!\nCharlie: I thought you came to say you were sick.\nRachel: Ok professor or detective?\nPhoebe: Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?\nRachel: Yeah, and he does it every year! That's why he's sending you to that play! That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!\nPhoebe: And that horrible museum tour!\nRoss: No, I arranged that...\nJoey:  Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun.\nPhoebe: We know about your party Joey.\nJoey: What party?\nMonica: The game's over! Take off your robe!\nJoey:  Ok... I mean...\nEveryone: No!!

Kyle Lowder!\nKyle Lowder:  Hi. \nMonica:  I love you!\nJoey: Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something...\nMonica: Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.\nPhoebe: Hey!\nMonica:  Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself.\nPhoebe: Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway? \nMonica:  Oh my God! Chandler!\n[Scene: The theater. Chandler is sitting in the otherwise empty front row, looking around nervously]\nChandler: Where the hell is everybody?\nBitter lady:  Why don't you like me?! Chapter One: My first period.\n[Scene: The Roof, Rachel is talking to a guy who hands her a tissue with something written on it]\nMonica:  Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this \"best wishes\" crap. I want \"love\".\nRachel: Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number.\nMonica: Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!\nMatthew Ashford: It was nice to meet you Rachel.\nRachel: Nice to meet you.\nMatthew Ashford: Call me.\nRachel: Ok\nMonica:  We will!!\nMonica:  Look at you with all the guys!\nRachel: Yeah!\nMonica: I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?\nRachel: Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!\nMonica: Please... Chandler is the love of my life... ... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! \nRoss:  So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?\nCharlie: Actually, I'm kinda happy to be leaving... I just broke up with someeone.\nRoss: Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?\nCharlie: Actually, Alby is the guy I broke up with.\nRoss: You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?\nCharlie: Yeah...\nRoss: ... And you called him Alby!?  I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...\nCharlie: Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.\nRoss: Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!\nCharlie: Yes! And while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend, he had a lot of issues...\nRoss:  Oh! like what?!  Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch \"Access Hollywood\".\nCharlie: Ok, you want the dirt? Alby was seriously insecure. I mean, he was really intimidated by the guy I dated before him.\nRoss: Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?\nCharlie: A guy who won two.\nRoss:  Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart\nCharlie: Yeah... for three years.\nRoss: Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?\nCharlie: ... no... bu but there was my first boyfriend Billy.\nRoss: Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?\nCharlie: No, but he did just win the McArthur genius grant.\nRoss: Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine? \nPhoebe: Hey Ross!\nRache: How is it going with Charlie?\nRoss:  Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.\nPhoebe: Oh, What's the matter?\nRoss: She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.\nRachel: I always loved that!!\nRoss: Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!!  Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God!\nPhoebe: Worse?\nRoss: Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians...  \"Can we walk\"?  Oh, you... you like that?\nPhoebe:  No. \nRoss: What? \nRachel: Come on! I think this is funny! \n[Scene: Chandler in the theater]\nBitter lady: Well, I bet you are all thinkin' \"Now would be a really great time for an intermission\", huh?\nChandler:  oh yes, God yes!!\nBitter lady:  Well, you're not gonna get one! Because in life there are no intermissions, people. Chapter 7: Divorce is a 4 letter word.  How could he leave me?!?!\nChandler: I... I don't know... you seem lovely.\n[Scene: The roof, Joey is walking towards Ross with a guy]\nJoey: Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk.

He talks slow but he might pee fast! Ok, let's go!! \n[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment]\nRoss:  Oh, hey you guys! This is Charlie! Charlie, this is Phoebe and my sister, Monica.\nPhoebe: Hi!\nRoss: Yeah, Charlie is gonna be joining my department.\nPhoebe: Oh, you're a paleonthologist, too!  Oh, ok, now, what do you think of Ranion's new theory of species' variegation in segmented arthopods?\nCharlie: Well, I think he's a little out there, but he does have some interesting ideas...\nPhoebe: Ah, ah.\nCharlie:  Oh, I'm sorry. I'll take this. Excuse me. \nRoss:  Ranion's theory of species variegation?\nPhoebe: Yeah, I saw the article on your coffee table and I memorized the title to freak you out!\nMonica:  So, did you two have fun?\nRoss: Oh my God, she's great! I mean, we-we have so much in common and she's just cool, and funny...\nMonica: And I don't know if you've noticed but she's a  HOTTY!!  HI!\nRachel:  Hey... Hi you guys! Listen, you know what? I'm not feeling really well. I think I can't get out for the play.\nRoss: Really? Wh-what's wrong?\nRachel: I don't know! I think it's kind of serious! Oh, you know... I was watching this thing on TV this morning about... Newcastle disease... and I think I might have it!!\nCharlie: Oh, Newcastle disease is a secretion borne virus that only affects chickens and... other poultry.\nRachel: ... Ok, who is this?\nRoss: I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.\nRachel: Oh, hi! I would check your hand but... I'm sure you don't want to get my chicken disease!\nMonica: Hey, Rachel, Can-can I see you for a sec?\nRachel: Sure!  Oh...\nMonica: You're not sick!\nRachel: What? Yes, I am!\nMonica: Ok, then, why are you...  all dressed up??\nRachel: When you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better! \nMonica: You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!\nRachel: Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!\nMonica: Ok, what is this?\nRachel: Ok!  Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you!\nMonica:  WHAT?\nRoss:  Wh-what's going on?\nMonica: Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!\nRachel: And he didn't want you guys to know about it but I came over here to tell you!!\nCharlie: I thought you came to say you were sick.\nRachel: Ok professor or detective?\nPhoebe: Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?\nRachel: Yeah, and he does it every year! That's why he's sending you to that play! That's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory!\nPhoebe: And that horrible museum tour!\nRoss: No, I arranged that...\nJoey:  Hey you guys, I'm turning in. Have fun.\nPhoebe: We know about your party Joey.\nJoey: What party?\nMonica: The game's over! Take off your robe!\nJoey:  Ok... I mean...\nEveryone: No!! Cover it up!!\nJoey:  Nice to meet ya! \n[Scene: The Roof]\nJoey:  Hey! Hey alright! Hey, glad you could make it  Thanks for coming.\nMonica: Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!\nKyle Lowder:  Hi. \nMonica:  I love you!\nJoey: Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something...\nMonica: Oh yeah that's what you want - my inhibitions lowered.\nPhoebe: Hey!\nMonica:  Oh my God, can you believe we are surrounded by all this? I can barely control myself.\nPhoebe: Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where is Chandler anyway? \nMonica:  Oh my God! Chandler!\n[Scene: The theater. Chandler is sitting in the otherwise empty front row, looking around nervously]\nChandler: Where the hell is everybody?\nBitter lady:  Why don't you like me?! Chapter One: My first period.\n[Scene: The Roof, Rachel is talking to a guy who hands her a tissue with something written on it]\nMonica:  Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this \"best wishes\" crap. I want \"love\".\nRachel: Ok actually Mon, Matthew was just giving me his phone number.\nMonica: Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!\nMatthew Ashford: It was nice to meet you Rachel.\nRachel: Nice to meet you.\nMatthew Ashford: Call me.\nRachel: Ok\nMonica:  We will!!\nMonica:  Look at you with all the guys!\nRachel: Yeah!\nMonica: I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?\nRachel: Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!\nMonica: Please... Chandler is the love of my life... ... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! \nRoss:  So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?\nCharlie: Actually, I'm kinda happy to be leaving... I just broke up with someeone.\nRoss: Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?\nCharlie: Actually, Alby is the guy I broke up with.\nRoss: You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?\nCharlie: Yeah...\nRoss: ... And you called him Alby!?  I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...\nCharlie: Yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.\nRoss: Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!\nCharlie: Yes! And while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend, he had a lot of issues...\nRoss:  Oh! like what?!  Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch \"Access Hollywood\".\nCharlie: Ok, you want the dirt? Alby was seriously insecure. I mean, he was really intimidated by the guy I dated before him.\nRoss: Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?\nCharlie: A guy who won two.\nRoss:  Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart\nCharlie: Yeah... for three years.\nRoss: Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?\nCharlie: ... no... bu but there was my first boyfriend Billy.\nRoss: Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?\nCharlie: No, but he did just win the McArthur genius grant.\nRoss: Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine? \nPhoebe: Hey Ross!\nRache: How is it going with Charlie?\nRoss:  Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.\nPhoebe: Oh, What's the matter?\nRoss: She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.\nRachel: I always loved that!!\nRoss: Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!!  Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God!\nPhoebe: Worse?\nRoss: Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians...  \"Can we walk\"?  Oh, you... you like that?\nPhoebe:  No. \nRoss: What? \nRachel: Come on! I think this is funny! \n[Scene: Chandler in the theater]\nBitter lady: Well, I bet you are all thinkin' \"Now would be a really great time for an intermission\", huh?\nChandler:  oh yes, God yes!!\nBitter lady:  Well, you're not gonna get one! Because in life there are no intermissions, people. Chapter 7: Divorce is a 4 letter word.  How could he leave me?!?!\nChandler: I... I don't know... you seem lovely.\n[Scene: The roof, Joey is walking towards Ross with a guy]\nJoey: Hey Ross, this is one of my co-stars, Dirk.  Dirk, this is my good friend Ross. \nRoss: Nice to meet you.\nDirk: Hey! So what show are you on?\nRoss: Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology.\nJoey: It's a science.\nDirk: Oh! Hey well listen, I play a scientist on \"Days\". And my character has just won the Nobel prize.\nJoey: Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or...\nRoss: Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.\nDirk: Hey, I got a 690 on my SATs.\nRoss: I'd lead with that.\nMonica: That's it, just sign right on the bra .\nJoey: Monica!\nMonica: Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year!\nJoey:  What have you got there?\nRoss: Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.\nJoey: Ah, let me see!  Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?\nRachel:  I think I am.\nJoey:  Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug . This guy's Canadian . And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different.\nJoey:  Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass...\nRachel:  Why, why, what's wrong with these guys?\nJoey: Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.\nRachel: Joey, you're so sweet.\nJoey: That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight.\nRachel: Who ?\nJoey: Me.\nRachel:  What?  Really?\nJoey: Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!\nRachel: Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it! \nJoey: Gotcha.\nRachel: Oh, Very funny... Joey.\nChandler:  So, how did you enjoy the play?\nMonica: Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry.\nChandler: Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.\nMonica: You really liked it?\nChandler: Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained  not to listen!  But after chapter 16: \"fat, single and ready to mingle\", I was uplifted.\nMonica: Oh really!\nChandler: Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!\nMonica: No!\nChandler: Did somebody sign your bra?\nMonica: So I got it when I was 13...\n[Scene: At the counter. Ross is sitting there, drinking. Phoebe approaches him.]\nPhoebe: Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?\nRoss: It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize.\nPhoebe: Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, \nslum it with some average Joe Phd.\nRoss: Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.\nPhoebe: You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny...\nRoss: And sexy.\nPhoebe: Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!\nRoss: Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her.\nPhoebe: Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!\nRoss: Stop going through my stuff !\nRachel:  Hey!\nMonica: Hey!\nRachel: I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.\nMonica: No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.\nRachel: Please, what about you and Chandler?\nMonica: That's different! I was drunk and stupid!\nRachel: Well hello !\nMonica: What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?\nRachel: I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!\nMonica: Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.\nRachel:  I'm gonna do it.\nMonica: And I can't stop you.\nRachel: No.\nRoss:  Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere?\nRoss: I'm smarter than him!\nClosing credits[Scene: The theater. Monica, Phoebe and Chandler are sitting in the first line]\nPhoebe: Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.\nChandler: Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.\nMonica: Oh, you're so wonderful.\nBitter woman: Why don't you like me!

Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch \"Access Hollywood\".\nCharlie: Ok, you want the dirt? Alby was seriously insecure.

Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart\nCharlie: Yeah... for three years.\nRoss: Oh my God!

I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.\nJoey: Phonetically? \nRoss: Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time \n  for this.\nJoey: Ok.\nRoss: Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, \n  I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!\nJoey: Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything!

But still, I mean, it seems like \n  you guys are having a great time together.\nCharlie: Yeah, it's fun .\nRoss: What?\nCharlie: Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really \n  know me that well; it would be weird.\nRoss: What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.\nCharlie: Well... I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy \n  to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common \n  with. You know what I mean?\nRoss:  Yeah. But you know what?

I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about \n  art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.\nCharlie: Yeah, I guess that's true.\nRoss: And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all \n  that stuff is because he thought it was important to you.

It \n  means...\nMonica: Chandler?\nChandler:  It means that we can keep trying, but there's \n  a good chance this may never happen for us.\nMonica:  Oh my God!\nChandler: I'm sorry.\nMonica: I'm sorry too.\n \nChandler: Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.\nMonica:  I know.\nClosing credits\n[Scene: The Spa Reception.

I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.\nJoey: Phonetically? \nRoss: Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time \n  for this.\nJoey: Ok.\nRoss: Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, \n  I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!\nJoey: Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on \"Days\" \n  I had to say \"Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy\".\nRoss: Wow. What does that mean?\nJoey: No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I \n  guess it means \"you're gonna get eaten by a bear\".\nRoss: Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?\nJoey: Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish \n  of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .\nRoss: Nah ah! Nah ah!  No no no!

Did you make your deposit?\nChandler: Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!\nJanice: That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes \n  next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?\nChandler: I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... \n  I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.\nJanice: Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.\nChandler:  Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there \n  is a reason why we can't have a baby?\nJanice: Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children. \n  I am sure it's gonna be just fine.\nChandler:  oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe \n  I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... \n  come here and do... 'that'...\nJanice: What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you \n  can't do it at a doctor's office?\nChandler:  It was a \"Wendy's!! \n  \"\n[Scene: Phoebe and Rachel at the Spa.

She's... uhm... not very good though... \nPhoebe: Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?\nRachel: I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy \n  fingers from playing crummy guitar...\nPhoebe: Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're \n  such a high maintenance tight ass!\nRachel:  Phoebe!!\nPhoebe: You know it's me?\nRachel: For like a half an hour!

Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?\nPhoebe: Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then \n  they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know... \n  you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! \n  paying taxes!\nRachel: Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there \n  right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles \n  and I so admire that! I don't have any!\nPhoebe: You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit.

Hey!\nCharlie: Hi!\nRoss: Hey, how was the Met?\nCharlie: The museum was amazing!\nRoss: Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?\nCharlie: Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to \n  say, and some of it didn't even make any sense.\nRoss: What do you mean?\nCharlie: Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere \n  around.\nRoss:  Wait a minute... when you guys walked \n  into the Met, did you go to the right?\nCharlie: No, we went to the left.\nRoss:  Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like \n  you guys are having a great time together.\nCharlie: Yeah, it's fun .\nRoss: What?\nCharlie: Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really \n  know me that well; it would be weird.\nRoss: What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.\nCharlie: Well... I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy \n  to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common \n  with. You know what I mean?\nRoss:  Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey \n  a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about \n  art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.\nCharlie: Yeah, I guess that's true.\nRoss: And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all \n  that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You \n  know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.\nCharlie: He is very sweet. Plus he's hot!\nRoss: That was going to be my next argument.\n \nJoey: Hey!\nRoss: Hey!\nCharlie: Hey!\nJoey:  You're ready?\nCharlie: Yeah, let's go.   Thanks \n  Ross.\nJoey:  Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me \n  up.\nRoss: Glad I could help man.\nJoey: Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna \n  be, but...  I made it work.\n[Scene: Monica and Chandler's. Chandler is sitting on the sofa, \n  reading the newspaper.]\nChandler:  It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.\n \nChandler: Hello?

Of course \n  it is not good news, you just said  \"Doctor Connelly just called\". \n  If it was good news you would have said  \"Doctor Connelly just \n  called! \" But so what is it?

Hey!\nCharlie: Hi!\nRoss: Hey, how was the Met?\nCharlie: The museum was amazing!\nRoss: Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?\nCharlie: Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to \n  say, and some of it didn't even make any sense.\nRoss: What do you mean?\nCharlie: Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere \n  around.\nRoss:  Wait a minute... when you guys walked \n  into the Met, did you go to the right?\nCharlie: No, we went to the left.\nRoss:  Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like \n  you guys are having a great time together.\nCharlie: Yeah, it's fun .\nRoss: What?\nCharlie: Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really \n  know me that well; it would be weird.\nRoss: What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.\nCharlie: Well... I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy \n  to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common \n  with. You know what I mean?\nRoss:  Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey \n  a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about \n  art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.\nCharlie: Yeah, I guess that's true.\nRoss: And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all \n  that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You \n  know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.\nCharlie: He is very sweet. Plus he's hot!\nRoss: That was going to be my next argument.\n \nJoey: Hey!\nRoss: Hey!\nCharlie: Hey!\nJoey:  You're ready?\nCharlie: Yeah, let's go.   Thanks \n  Ross.\nJoey:  Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me \n  up.\nRoss: Glad I could help man.\nJoey: Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna \n  be, but...  I made it work.\n[Scene: Monica and Chandler's. Chandler is sitting on the sofa, \n  reading the newspaper.]\nChandler:  It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.\n \nChandler: Hello?

Of course \n  it is not good news, you just said  \"Doctor Connelly just called\". \n  If it was good news you would have said  \"Doctor Connelly just \n  called! \" But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem \n  with me or with you?\nChandler: Actually it's both of us.\nMonica: What?\nChandler: Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable \n  environment.\nMonica: Oh... what does that mean?\nChandler: It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers \n  and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do.  It \n  means...\nMonica: Chandler?\nChandler:  It means that we can keep trying, but there's \n  a good chance this may never happen for us.\nMonica:  Oh my God!\nChandler: I'm sorry.\nMonica: I'm sorry too.\n \nChandler: Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.\nMonica:  I know.\nClosing credits\n[Scene: The Spa Reception.
